This is a script based on the Cloudflare Worker platform. Based on the original version, it is modified to display Trojan configuration information and convert it into subscription content. Using this script, you can easily convert Trojan configuration information to tools such as Clash or Singbox using online configuration.

        let addresses = [
        // any Domain or clean IPv4/IPv6 addresses from cloudflare is usable, no sweat.
        'cdnjs.com:443#N1',
        'www.wto.org:2053#N2',
        'sky.rethinkdns.com#N3',
        'creativecommons.org#N4',
        '[2606:4700:310c::ac42:2c39]#N5 âˆšIPv6',
      ];
        ```

    - For example `https://vless.trauma.workers.dev/auto?sub` Base64 subscription format, suitable for PassWall, SSR+, etc.
    - For example `https://vless.trauma.workers.dev/auto?clash` Clash subscription format, suitable for OpenClash, etc.
    - For example `https://vless.trauma.workers.dev/auto?sb` singbox subscription format, suitable for singbox, etc.

     www.speedtest.net:443#N1
     speed.cloudflare.com#N2
     zula.ir#N3
     creativecommons.org:2053#N4
     sky.rethinkdns.com#N5
     104.17.152.41#IPv4 is available
     [2606:4700:310c::ac42:2c39]#also IPv6

## ProxyIP

1. When deploy in cloudflare pages, you can set proxyIP in 4th line of `_worker.js` file. or set environment variable, variable name is `PROXYIP`

2. When deploy in worker.dev, you can set proxyIP in 4th line of `_worker.js` file. or set environment variable, variable name is `proxyIP`

### How to find proxyIP

## Environment variables description

> [!NOTE]
> Only set two of them is sufficient, the first variable `PASSWORD` and the second `PROXYIP` , variables listed in the table below are only for educational purposes and additional explanations.
